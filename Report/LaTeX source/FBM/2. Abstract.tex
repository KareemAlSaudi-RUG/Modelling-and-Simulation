                Traffic jams are a common problem that can be found in many a country's infrastructure on a global scale. Within the current literature, a plethora of models exist that aim to simulate their formation both in an attempt to help us better understand and reinforce our understanding of their generation as well as to potentially uncover previously unconsidered reasons associated with their emergence. This paper seeks to take a closer look at one such model, namely the Biham-Middleton-Levine traffic model, in order to get a baseline of understanding as to how and why traffic jams occur.
